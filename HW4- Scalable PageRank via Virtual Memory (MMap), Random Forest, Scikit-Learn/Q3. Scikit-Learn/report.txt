Part A

Linear Regression - 
	Training Accuracy: 0.924180
	Testing Accuracy: 0.803336

SVM -
	Training Accuracy: 1.0
	Testing Accuracy: 0.803775

MLP - 
	Training Accuracy: 0.730533
	Testing Accuracy: 0.785777

Random Forest - 
	Training Accuracy: 0.996926
	Testing Accuracy: 0.948200

****************************************
Part B - Hyperparameter tuning

Random Forest - 
	n_estimators: 
		What it does (at most 25 words):This metric provides number of trees created in the forest. A higher number of trees makes the code slower and more accurate.
		Values tested (at least 3): 10,100,100

	max_depth: 
		What it does:This metric provides the maximum depth of any tree created. The more depth a tree has, the slower and more accurate it will be.
		Values tested (at least 3): 100,150,200
		
	Best combination of parameter values:
		n_estimators: 30
		max_depth: 200

	Testing Accuracy before tuning (default parameters): 0.948200
	Testing Accuracy after tuning: 0.954918


SVM -
	Kernels: 
		What it does: The linear kernel implements linear regression and the RBF kernel implements the radial bias function. Since the data is linear, the former is more accurate
		Values tested: rbf, linear
	C: 
		What it does: This metric provides the penalty parameter of the error term. For smaller values of C, the algorithm is more finely tuned and is more accurate. 
		Values tested (at least 3): 0.001,0.1,10
		
	Best combination of parameter values: 
		Kernel: linear
		C: 0.001
	
	Testing Accuracy before tuning  (default parameters): 0.803775
	Testing Accuracy after tuning: 0.821721


****************************************
Part C

For your SVM's CV run from part B, state the highest mean testing accuracy 
across the sets of parameter values and its corresponding mean train score and mean fit time. 

SVM's highest mean testing/cross-validated accuracy: 82%
SVM's mean train score: 82%
SVM's mean fit time: 0.0593 sec

****************************************
Part D

Tuned SVM's testing accuracy BEFORE preprocessing: 0.803775
Tuned SVM's testing accuracy AFTER preprocessing: 0.818648
Why you think it increased, decreased, or stayed the same: The StandardScaler was used, which removed the mean from the data and scaled data to unit variance. As x_test had its values near its mean removed, this made the sorting easier for the classifier, which was able to increase its overall accuracy on the new data.

****************************************
Part E

Best Classifier: Random Forest
Why: The Random Forest classifier works best for given data, giving an accuracy of 95% at times. This is because the data exhibits a large variance and is relatively non-linear, giving it an edge over SVM and linear respectively. Its much quicker than SVM, as it uses the data as is.
