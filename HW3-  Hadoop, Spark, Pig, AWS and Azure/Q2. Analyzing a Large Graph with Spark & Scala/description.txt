In this question we are asked to implement mapReduce in SCALA to find the gross average node weight for each node in the graph. We create 2 variables, source weight ‘src_wt’ and target weight ‘tgt-wt’. For both of them, the input line is read and split into groups according to tabs.(Line 20,21) The first and second values act as keys for the 2 variables respectively. For the src_wt keys, the value is a +1 and for the tgt_wt keys, the value is a -1.  The entries are grouped according to each key, and each value is summed up and divided by the size of the node on line 23,24. This provides the total average for both source and target, the latter being negative. The lists are joined, using union and grouped by their keys to get the final value. The values are then stored in TSV format.
